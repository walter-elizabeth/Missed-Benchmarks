# Missed Benchmarks: Measuring the 2030 Emissions Gap 

## SSC 442 Final Project, Research Report & Business Memo-Style Writing Samples

In the spring of 2025, I decided to re-do a project initially completed as part of my senior capstone course for my minor in Social Science Quantitative Data Analytics for my Economics B.A. with better, updated data. I also expanded on the scope of the project, changing it from a short memo to a more research and policy oriented paper.

The focus of the project was to devise a question to investigate, find and merge datasets, create data visualizations, and put said visualizations into a brief memo meant for a C-Suite executive explaining your findings. In the new project, more background information, analysis, and solutions for industry-specific sources of emissions and mitigations were included.

I chose to evaluate the emission reduction pledges made by countries that signed the Paris Agreement. I used historical data and prediction models to understand their current and expected trajectories for yearly emissions. I then compared those trends and estimates to their pledged reductions in their nationally determined contributions through 2030. I did the same for global GHG data and compared that estimated data to the median-cost warming pathways for 1.5 and 2 degrees celsius to measure that gap in 2030.

I have included the project instructions, final reports (the concise memo and the longer, more policy-focused report), and code to explore.
