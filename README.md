# Missed Benchmarks: Measuring the 2030 Emissions Gap 

## SSC 442 Final Project, Research Report/Memo-Style Writing Sample

This project was completed as part of my senior capstone course for my minor in Social Science Quantitative Data Analytics for my Economics B.A.

The focus of the project was to devise a question to investigate, find and merge datasets, create data visualizations, and put said visualizations into a brief memo meant for a C-Suite executive explaining your findings.

I chose to evaluate the emission reduction pledges made by countries that signed the Paris Agreement. I used historical data and prediction models to understand their current and expected trajectories for yearly emissions, then compared those to their pledged reductions in their nationally determined contributions. I did the same for global GHG data and compared that estimated data to the median-cost warming pathways for 1.5 and 2 degrees celsius to measure that gap in 2030.

I have included the project instructions, final report, and code to explore.
