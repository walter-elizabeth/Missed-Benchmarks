# Final Project Instructions
1. For your final project in this class, you will analyze existing data in some area of interest to you. You will aggregate (merge) datasets, “find a pattern in the data that cannot be expressed in a closed form”, and communicate your findings in a memo

2. You must visualize (at least) three interesting features of that data. Visualizations should aid the reader in understanding something about the data that might not be readily apparent.

3. You must come up with some analysis—using tools from the course—which relates your data to either a prediction or a policy conclusion. For example, if you collected data from Major League Baseball games, you could try to “predict” whether a left-hander was pitching based solely on the outcomes of the batsmen. If you assembled data from COVID lockdowns and unemployment, you could test hypotheses about the labor market and its reaction to COVID.

You must write and present your analysis as if presenting to a C-suite executive. Generally speaking, such executives are not particularly analytically oriented, and therefore your explanations need to be clear, concise (their time is valuable) and contain actionable (or valuable) information. The report should be no more than 3 pages (excluding figures and tables). Concretely, this requires a written memo, which describes the data, analyses, and results. This must be clear and easy to understand for a non-expert in your field. Tell the reader what data you used and what you found, not about the process.

### Outline

#### Introduction
Describe the motivation for this analysis. Briefly describe the dataset(s), and explain why the analysis you’re undertaking matters for society. (Or matters for some decision-making. You should not feel constrained to asking only “big questions.” The best projects will be narrow-scope but well-defined.) 

#### Theory and Background
Provide in-depth background about your analytics question. Provide some theoretical guidance to the functional relationship you hope to explore. EX: If you’re interested on how, say, height affects scoring in the NBA, write down a proposed function that might map height to scoring. Describe how you might look for this unknown relationship in the data, but do not describe the data yet. Explain the ‘why’.

#### Hypotheses
Make predictions to form the questions that you will study. Declare what you think will happen You should be able to reject or fail to reject these hypotheses based on your analyses. 

#### Data
Given your motivations, limits on feasibility, and hypotheses, describe the data you use. 

#### Analyses
Generate the analyses relevant to your hypotheses and interests. Here you must include three figures and must describe what they contain in simple, easy to digest language. Why did you visualize these elements? Your analyses also must include brief discussion.

#### Conclusion
What caveats should we consider? Do you believe this is a truly causal relationship? Or, if a predictive project, how well did you do and should we bet money / diagnose / rely on your prediction? Why does any of this matter to the decision-maker?


### The following four elements of your project will be evaluated:

1. Technical skills: Was the project easy? Does it showcase mastery of R for data analysis? (20%)

2. Visual design: Was the information smartly conveyed and usable? Was it beautiful? (25%)

3. Analytic design: Was the analysis appropriate? Was it sensible, given the dataset? Did you miss any glaring issues? (20%)

4. Story: Did we learn something? Did you explore your findings sufficiently deeply? (25%)

5. Following instructions: Did you surpress R code as asked? (10%)
